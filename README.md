# Project-KILATIS

Corruption in public procurement is a persistent systemic failure in the Philippines, costing the government billions annually through bid-rigging, retroactive document tampering, and "ghost projects." While digital platforms like PhilGEPS have modernized job posting, they remain centralized systems where administrative privilege can be weaponized to alter audit trails. This study argues that policy reform alone is insufficient; technological enforcement is required. We introduce Project K.I.L.A.T.I.S. (Key Immutable Ledger for Audit, Transparency, and Integrity Systems)—a hybrid-permissioned blockchain model designed to enforce Republic Act No. 9184. Unlike theoretical proposals, this study validates the model through Design Science Research (DSR). Using the Remix IDE to simulate the "Smart Contract" layer, we demonstrate how algorithmic code can enforce bidding deadlines and reject tampered documents without human intervention. The results confirm that KILATIS offers a technically feasible, trustless architecture that transforms auditing from a reactive post-mortem analysis to a proactive, real-time guarantee.
